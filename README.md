# Waves

## About

Waves is an iOS app that allows users to share and discover new music across Apple Music and Spotify. In my experience, I've always had to text a song to someone or ask a friend what the name of a song was that they were listening to a few days ago. With Waves, those kinds of problems go away. You can see all your friends' top songs based on their listening habits, and easily find the music that both you and your friends enjoy listening to.

## How it works

Waves allows users to share their music across Spotify and Apple Music. It introduces what I like to call "passive sharing", meaning that the sharing process is not actively having to be carried out by the person who's music is of interest.

It's simple. Just login with Spotify or Apple Music, search for a friend you want to share music with, and instantly see what their top songs are. It's that easy. No more "50 clicks" to get to their account on Spotify only to be presented with a few public playlists that are half maintained or updated every 3 months.

For the future, we plan to allow friends to see each others' recently played songs, as well as pin their favorite music to their profile to make it more personal.
